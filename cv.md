##### My goal is to improve my knowledge in web development stack as well as in related dev approaches(git) as it's partly required at my current working position. I'm longing for engaging myself in creating things that help to simplify and to improve the quality of using information technologies. I find HTML/CSS/JS/Node.js stack wholesome not only for its direct purpose,i.e. web development, but also for auxiliary purposes like local HTTP services/draw.io diagrams and bunch of others. Imagination is the only limitation =)
